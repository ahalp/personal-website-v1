Personal Website v1

My initial attempt at building a website. It was largely a learning experience for me-- my prior knowledge in web-development was limited to basic html/css/js. I used Harvard's CS75 online lectures to get up to snuff with the fundamentals of dynamic websites, and this was essentially the outcome. The website is built with PHP (no frameworks) and uses a MySQL database for the projects. It's fairly simple, and the MVC structure I tried to implement isn't really that great.
