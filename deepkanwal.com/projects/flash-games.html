<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>
I built a bunch of simple flash games throughout high school. These games were created using with Flash + ActionScript 2.0 but most of the time I would find tutorials on how to build similar games, and model my games of them. ActionScript 2.0 was my first exposure to any sort of programming although I don't remember it all that well. At the time, I knew enough to know what each block of code was doing and how to manipulate it, but not so much why it was doing that. Despite being relatively simple, these games did surprisingly quite well online, totaling just over 150,000 views to date. Because of that, and the fact that they were my first exposure to programming, I've included them on this website.

<h2>Games</h2>
<p>Here are a select handful of the games in chronological order.</p>

			<h3 class="spaces">Virtual DS  /  2008</h3>
			<p> My first real flash project. Interact with the virtual Nintendo DS by clicking and holding various parts of it. It's ridiculously simple-- nothing more than a bunch of buttons. </p>

			<h3>Metroid: The Flash Game (2008)</h3>
			<p> Another "button" based flash game, although this one was a little bit more involved than Virtual DS. This one is themed after the Metroid Prime games.</p>

			<h3 class="spaces">Paper Mario Musical  /  2009</h3>
			<p> Probably my favourite of my flash projects, Paper Mario Musical is a simple 2D game where you can make Mario dance to three songs (Staying Alive / Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough / Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger). Use the arrow and the z,x,c,v keys to control Mario. </p>

		<div>
			<h3 class="spaces">Links's Great Escape  /  2009</h3>
			<p> A 2D top down Zelda themed game based on the flash game Security. I used <a href="http://www.emanueleferonato.com/2007/04/20/create-a-flash-game-like-security-part-1/"> this tutorial </a> to build this game. The game is a bit glitch-y in the last (sea) level.</p>

		<div>
			<h3 class="spaces">Animal Crossing: Tortimer's Adventure  /  2010</h3>
			<p>A 2D side-scrolling platformer based of the Animal Crossing franchise. I love the way this turned out visually. This game was never actually completed, it has three levels and then stops abruptly. </p>

		<div>
			<h3 class="spaces">Zelda Platformer  /  2011</h3>
			<p> This was the only flash game I made after high school. It's a simple 2D action platformer, and since I had a bit of programming experience by the time I made this, I was able to do most of the logic myself rather than relying primarily on a tutorial. The game itself is a bit buggy though. </p>
