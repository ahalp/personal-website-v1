<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>
This is a simple website where I'll be posting my projects. It's largely a learning experience for me-- my prior knowledge in web-development was limited to basic html/css/js. I used Harvard's CS75 online lectures to get up to snuff with the fundamentals of dynamic websites, and this is essentially the outcome. I'm using PHP on the server side with a MySQL database for storing my projects. The website is responsive, although that's kinda trivial given its simple layout.

<h2> Resources </h2>
<ul>
	<li> <a href="https://www.cs75.net/Lectures"> CS75: Building Dynamic Websites </a> : This is an awesome resource for learning the fundamentals of dynamic web development. There are nine lectures, each about two hours long + an hour long tutorial at the end of most lectures.  </li>
