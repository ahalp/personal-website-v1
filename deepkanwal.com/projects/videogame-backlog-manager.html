<h2> Overview </h2>
<p>
Videogame Backlog Manager (VBM) is a simple app to help to manage your video game backlog and collection. You can search for games and add them to your library. When adding a game, you can specify your progress and wheather or not you are currently playing and/or have beaten the game. Using this information, VBM provides a simple way to keep track of your now playing list, your backlog and your library. VBM uses the <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/api/">GiantBomb API </a> for game data.

<h2> Privacy Policy </h2>

<p>
VBM uses Google Analytics to collect traffic data. This includes data such as user interactions within the app, devices used and location (granularity is limited to city). The data is not personally identifiable. VBM uses  Google Analytics purely to determine the usage of the different areas of the app. This will allow me to determine which areas of the app I should target for future updates. Crashlytics is also used to to send back logs in the event of a crash. This includes information about the device the crash occured on (ie. iOS version, orientation, system usage). This information is used to allow me to respond to crashes as they happen.
